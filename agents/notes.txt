Current Issues/Work To Do:
- Tune the architecture or hyperparameters to achieve a better BC performance.
- Training DAgger agent for at least 100 datasets/epochs.
- Possibly use another expert policy for BC or DAgger instead of ourselves.
- Right now REINFORCE dominates any starting policy, figure out how to limit this.
- REINFORCE achieves 0 training loss quickly, but doesn't get good results.
- Basic exploration term for REINFORCE is given, but we need to mess with it more.
