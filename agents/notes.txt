We got an online expert to train BC on, realized that it used different features
than just the board, so we modified our agent to use similar features. This should
achieve a better BC result. Note that we had to go into library source code in
order to achieve the changes that we wanted. The environment was modified in such
a way that pieces wouldn't be put on the leftmost column, so we have to fix that

Current Issues/Work To Do:
- Training DAgger agent for at least 10 datasets.
- Add more heuristics than just the 4 that the expert uses.

- Right now REINFORCE dominates any starting policy, figure out how to limit this.
- REINFORCE achieves 0 training loss quickly, but doesn't get good results.
- Basic exploration term for REINFORCE is given, but we need to mess with it more.
