## The environment we are using is
https://github.com/Max-We/Tetris-Gymnasium

## To get started 
Run ''' make build ''' to create a python virtual environment with the necessary library requiremnent

## To collect data 
Run ''' make run_bc_collect''', this will also save your dataset in a folder called "data"

We also have an interactive demo Jupyter Notebook that you can play with to get familiar with how the environment works
