## The environment we are using is
https://github.com/Max-We/Tetris-Gymnasium

## To get started 
Run `make build` to create a python virtual environment with the necessary library requiremnent

Run `make collect_bc` to play a game and save the trajectory in a folder called `data/BC`

We also have an interactive demo Jupyter Notebook that you can play with to get familiar with how the environment works
